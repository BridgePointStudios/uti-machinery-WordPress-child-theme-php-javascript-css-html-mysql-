I made a WordPress custom child theme for this project.
The client needed to upload from his Access database to the site.
I used custom post types and custom fields to make the layout match the clients instructions.

The custom theme is child of Divi and uses custom PHP, HTML, CSS, JAVASCRIPT, MYSQL, and custom WordPress functions and methods.
